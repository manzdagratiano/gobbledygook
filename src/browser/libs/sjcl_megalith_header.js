/**
 * @fileOverview    sjcl_megalith_header.js
 *                  This "megalith" file is a concatenation of the
 *                  applicable SJCL sources into a giant agglomeration -
 *                  a megalith indeed. The nomenclature, even though
 *                  the stuff of common parlance, is instead inspired
 *                  from the "megastructure" in the manga "Blame!"
 *                  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!]
 *                  by Tsutomu Nihei, of which
 *                  the author of "gobbledygook" is a fanatical fan.
 *                  The purpose of this file is to act as
 *                  a "full source replacement" for
 *                  the minified version of the SJCL library "sjcl.js"
 *                  in the root of the SJCL source tree
 *                  [https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl],
 *                  which, though phenomenal for transmission,
 *                  is obfuscated code.
 *                  The entire source code that follows
 *                  below this comment block is due entirely
 *                  to the original SJCL authors,
 *                  and is subject to the same license as SJCL.
 *                  Please refer to the SJCL README's for more information.
